	{NONE}
	In front of you, a wounded soldier lays.
	His body is racked with the pains of war, as he grunts and coughs harshly.
	It's my duty, as the only medic for this sector, to try and treat these poor souls.
	#Me
	Alrighty, sir. I am going to look you over okay? I need to check for any major injuries.
	{NONE}
	The soldier just grunts, pain being the only thing his brain can think of.
	I'll need to look over each area of his body to try and find what's wrong.
	{CALL} (dialogue_wait_find_injury | tut | LARM)
	There, lodged deep into the muscle, a bullet.
	It doesn't look fatal, but I can't just leave him in pain like this.
	If I check my clipboard, I should be able to see what I need to do to take care of this.
	{CALL} (dialogue_wait_open_clipboard)
	Let's see here...
	I think the best course of action is to take out the bullet with tongs, then bandage him up.
	I should be able to find what I need in the medicine cabinet back in the main area.
	I should also be able to write down stuff here on the right in case I need to refer back to it.

	{CALL} (dialogue_add_injury | tut | LARM | infection)
	{CALL} (dialogue_update_patient_display)
	There, all better.
	Though it looks as though the area is getting red and hot.
	Likely an infection from the wound being open for so long. I'll need to fight this off too.
	There are a few different ways I could try to treat him... But I can't just spend all the medicine on one guy.
	I should probably stick to one of the simpler options so I don't run out of medication.
	{CALL} (dialogue_wait_treat_injury_fail | tut | LARM | infection)
	Hmm... That didn't seem to work. This infection is strong.
	I can't guarantee the meds I give will cure everything. Though I should be able to try again and hit it harder.
	The medicine I already used is still there, so it should still be able to help, even if I add more to it.
	{CALL} (dialogue_wait_treat_injury_succeed | tut | LARM | infection)
	There we go, the redness is starting to die down. He should be good to go now.
	#Me
	Alrighty soldier, that's all I can do for you. Try to take it easy, alright?
	{NONE}
	The soldier nods, standing up slowly and begins to walk out of the tent.
